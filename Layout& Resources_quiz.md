### Short Answer Questions

1. A `PopupMenu` is typically anchored to a view and appears as a dropdown, while a `ContextMenu` is triggered by a long-press and is associated with specific UI elements. `PopupMenu` is more like a lightweight menu for small actions, whereas `ContextMenu` is context-specific and allows more extensive actions.
2. You can handle click events for menu items by overriding the `onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item)` method in the activity or fragment. Each menu item has an ID, and you can use a switch-case block to handle actions based on the selected item's ID.
3. The `NumberPicker` widget allows users to pick a number from a range of values, while a `DatePicker` is a specialized widget designed for selecting dates, including day, month, and year.
4. To create a custom `TimePickerDialog`, you can instantiate the `TimePickerDialog` class, pass a `TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener` to handle the selected time, and customize the dialogâ€™s UI or behavior as needed.
5. You can dynamically update menu items in an `OptionsMenu` by overriding the `onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu menu)` method. This method is called every time the menu is about to be shown, allowing you to modify the menu items before displaying them to the user.

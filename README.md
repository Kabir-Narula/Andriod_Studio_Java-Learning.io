## Project Structure

Each project directory typically includes:

- **Java Source Code** (`src/main/java/`): The main logic and functionality of the app.
- **XML Layout Files** (`src/main/res/layout/`): Defines the UI structure and design.
- **Manifest File** (`src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`): Declares app components, permissions, and configurations.
- **Gradle Build Files** (`build.gradle`): Manages dependencies and builds configurations for the project.
